# equation-finder
Attempts to find various equations given three points

Currently three equations are available. For each equation, the program tries to find A, B, and C.
1. Exponential
$$y = e^{A(x + B)} + C$$
Try it here: https://kdjdev.github.io/equation-finder/?func=exp.

2. Logarithmic
$$y = Aln(x+B) + C$$
Try it here: https://kdjdev.github.io/equation-finder/?func=log.

2. Doozy function
$$y = A \left( \left( x + \frac{1}{B} \right) \cdot \ln(Bx + 1) - x \right) + Cx$$
Try it here: https://kdjdev.github.io/equation-finder/?func=doozy.
This final function was derived specifically to meet certain requirements for a project.
